# Enhanced Asset Management for Municipal Corporations

## Problem Statement
Municipal corporations manage a diverse range of assets, including infrastructure, vehicles, equipment, public buildings, and parks. Efficient management of these assets is crucial for ensuring public safety, optimizing maintenance costs, and improving the quality of public services.

## Objective
Develop innovative solutions to enhance the asset management capabilities of municipal corporations. The goal is to create a system or tool that can help municipalities better track, maintain, and optimize the use of their assets.

## Project Structure
This repository is organized into four main folders, each containing code for different parts of the project:

1. **Server Folder**
   - Contains the backend code developed in Express.js.
   - This is the main folder where users can run the project backend.

2. **Frontend Folder**
   - Contains the frontend code developed in React.

3. **PHP Folder**
   - Contains the code for the dashboard and live tracking.

4. **Machine Learning Folder**
   - Contains the implementation of prediction models and algorithms.

## Features Developed
### Asset Tracking and Inventory Management
- Implemented a digital system to catalog and track all municipal assets.
- Utilized technologies such as IoT for real-time asset tracking.

### Predictive Maintenance
- Created algorithms to predict when assets will need maintenance or replacement.
- Scheduled maintenance activities efficiently to minimize disruptions.

### Resource Allocation
- Optimized the allocation of resources (e.g., personnel, equipment, budget) for asset maintenance and management.
- Developed tools for budget planning and expenditure tracking related to asset management.

### Data Integration and Analytics
- Used data analytics to gain insights into asset performance and utilization.
- Provided visualization tools for easy interpretation of data by municipal staff.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm
- React
- PHP
- Python (for machine learning)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asset-management.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the Server folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd Server
   npm install
   ```
3. Navigate to the Frontend folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../Frontend
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up the PHP folder for the dashboard and live tracking as per your local server requirements.
5. Navigate to the Machine Learning folder and set up the environment for running the prediction algorithms.

### Running the Project
1. Start the backend server from the Server folder:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Start the frontend server from the Frontend folder:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Ensure your local server is running for the PHP folder.
4. Run the machine learning scripts from the Machine Learning folder.
